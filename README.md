# Cifar10-tensorflow
# Overview
This project focuses on building a classification model using TensorFlow for the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a well-known benchmark dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and dogs. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images into these 10 classes.

# Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is divided into training and test sets, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image is labeled with one of the 10 classes. The dataset is preprocessed to normalize pixel values and is typically augmented with techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to improve model generalization.

# Model Architecture
The classification model is built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The architecture of the model may vary, but common choices include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) consisting of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. Techniques like dropout and batch normalization may be used to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
